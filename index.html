    <p>My name is Alex Simuro. I am 18 years old. I am 5 feet and 11 inches tall and weigh 150 pounds. I just graduated from Bishop Ireton High School. In the Spring semester, I will be attending Boston University. I am very excited to continue my educational career in computer science in Boston.</p>
    <p> I have been a sports fan since I can remember. My favorite teams are the Washingon Capitals, Arsenal, and the Lakers. No, I am not a bandwagon, I followed the Lakers before Lebron James was there. My favorite player in the NHL is Alexander Ovechkin, and my favorite player in the NBA is Lonzo Ball behind the retired GOAT, Kobe Bryant.
        Growing up I played hockey, soccer, and basketball if you could not tell. I was never very good at basketball so hockey and soccer became my main two sports. Next year when I am eligible to play, I am planning to try and walk on to the D1 team at Boston University. If that doesn't work out I would be happy to play on the club team there.  </p>
    <p>I am 50% italian, so obviously my favorite foods are pasta and pizza. However, I also am a huge fan of mexican food. Chipotle is my favorite food chain, followed by Chik-fil-a.  </p>
